This directory contains the pieces from wpilib that are needed.  THis is the network tables libraries
and the libraries they depend on.  I get the source from the allwpilib git repo, build just the network
table code which builds its dependencies, and then copy those complete directories here.  As such these
are not part of the git repo here.

cd temp
git clone https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib.git
./gradlew ntcore:build
cp -r ntcore wpinet wpiutil THIS_DIRECTOR Y
